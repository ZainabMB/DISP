The Automation Folder contains all the relevant code to run. The entity package maps out the database, the repository package makes calls to the database, the service package contains all the business logic, and the worker package makes calls to Camunda. We used a PostGreSQL Database and the schema of the database ER model is linked inside, called "probuilds er model.png"

The [Strategic Business Process Model](https://github.com/ZainabMB/DISP/tree/4e94dce68d8076a3e3e4e7145fb5fe441125f6d9/Strategic%20Business%20Process%20Model) shows the BPMN strategic model of probuilds process.

The [Operational BPMN model and forms](https://github.com/ZainabMB/DISP/tree/6c33683c06ebd68cfae95eb558968e4372b18c58/Operational%20BPMN%20model%20and%20forms) contains the operational model and the forms needed to deploy.

The [Automation Folder](https://github.com/ZainabMB/DISP/blob/main/Automation) contains all the Java code used to automate the operational model.

The [Database Artifacts](https://github.com/ZainabMB/DISP/blob/main/Database%20Artefacts) contain the table schema(s) creation script for the Java Automation.

The [I* Model](https://github.com/ZainabMB/DISP/blob/main/i*%20Models)s Folder contains the i* Model saved as a .txt file, ready to be downloaded and opened within the piStar tool.

The Strategic Dependency Model will be updated and edited via the .txt file itself, to open it download the file and open it within piStar (https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~jhcp/pistar/tool/).

# ProBuilds Tool Management System

A business process automation system built with **Camunda 8**, **Spring Boot**, and **PostgreSQL**, 
designed to manage the end-to-end lifecycle of tool hire and sale operations for a tools retailer, ProBuilds Ltd.

---


## Features

### Customer Journey
- In-store and online order flows
- Tool availability checking with real-time stock from individual tool instances
- Dynamic pricing based on tool type and hire duration
- Delivery and pickup distribution options with a £4 delivery fee

### Membership & Loyalty
- Member registration with automatic ID generation
- Membership validation against the database
- Loyalty points system — 100 points = 1% discount, max 10% (not fully implemented)
- £10 membership registration fee added to order total

### Payment Processing
- Cash and card payment support (card only for online orders)
- Card expiry validation
- Credit/finance application flow for orders over £100
- Integration with Fintrust for credit decisions via message events
- 6 and 12 month instalment plans

### Inventory Management
- Tool instance tracking — each physical tool has its own record with a serial number
- Instance status lifecycle: `AVAILABLE → HIRED/SOLD → RETURNED/MAINTENANCE → AVAILABLE/RETIRED`
- Automatic stock count derived from available instances
- Order-to-instance association tracking via `order_tool_instance`

### Hire Management
- Hire order creation with issue date, expected return date, and condition logging
- Rental agreement activation on tool pickup
- Automatic `LATE` status for overdue hire orders via scheduled job
- Tool return flow with condition assessment
- Maintenance transfer workflow with authorisation approval
- Tools marked as `AVAILABLE` or `RETIRED` post-maintenance

### Order Fulfilment
- Separate hire and sale order tables
- Delivery confirmation and pickup notification flows
- Order status tracking: `PENDING → PICKED_UP/DELIVERED`

## Database Schema

The system uses two schemas:

**`probuilds`** — core business data
- `member` — customer membership records with loyalty points
- `tool` — tool catalogue with type and pricing
- `tool_instance` — individual physical tool records with serial numbers and status
- `hire_order` — hire transactions with condition logs and return tracking
- `sale_order` — sale transactions
- `order_tool_instance` — association between orders and specific tool instances
- `credit_plan` — instalment plan records

**`fintrust`** — credit processing data
- `credit_plan` — credit applications and repayment schedules

---

## Process Workers

Each Camunda job type is handled by a dedicated Spring component following a 
**Worker → Service** pattern:

| Job Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `checkAvailability` | Fetches available tools by type from tool instances |
| `membershipValidation` | Validates membership number against DB |
| `membershipRegistration` | Registers new member and returns member ID |
| `calculatePrice` | Calculates total with hire days, delivery fee, loyalty discount |
| `processApplication` | Checks for existing active credit plan |
| `createCreditApplication` | Generates UUID application ID |
| `sendCreditApplication` | Publishes message to Fintrust process |
| `createCreditPlan` | Saves approved credit plan to DB |
| `sendApplicationDecision` | Publishes credit decision back to main process |
| `processPayment` | Validates payment details including card expiry |
| `createOrder` | Creates hire/sale order and marks tool instances |
| `orderDetails` | Publishes order details message |
| `activateRentalAgreement` | Updates hire order with issue details and sets PICKED_UP |
| `deliveryConfirmation` | Marks sale order as DELIVERED |
| `informCustomer` | Marks order as PICKED_UP and notifies customer |
| `transferMaintenanceTools` | Sets tool instances to MAINTENANCE |
| `sendAuthorisationRequest` | Publishes maintenance authorisation request |
| `sendRepairDecision` | Publishes repair decision correlated by serial number |
| `ToolsReturned` | Publishes tools returned message |
| `markToolsAvailable` | Sets instances to AVAILABLE or RETIRED post-maintenance |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 21
- Maven
- PostgreSQL
- Camunda 8 Self-Managed (c8run)

### Setup

**1. Start Camunda:**
```bash
cd ~/Downloads/camunda8-getting-started-bundle/c8run-8.9.0/
./c8run start
```

**2. Create the database schemas:**
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA probuilds;
CREATE SCHEMA fintrust;
```
then run [db.sql ](https://github.com/ZainabMB/DISP/blob/main/Database%2520Artefacts)

**3. Run the SQL scripts** to create tables, enums and seed data.

**4. Configure `application.properties`:**
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_db
spring.datasource.username=your_user
spring.datasource.password=your_password
zeebe.client.broker.grpcAddress=http://localhost:26500
zeebe.client.broker.restAddress=http://localhost:8080
```

**5. Deploy the BPMN processes** via Camunda Modeler.

**6. Run the Spring Boot application:**
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**7. Access Camunda Operate** at `http://localhost:8080` to monitor process instances.
